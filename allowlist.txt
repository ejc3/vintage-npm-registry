# Vintage NPM Registry - Allowlist
#
# Add package@version entries to allow specific versions
# that bypass date filtering rules.
#
# Format:
#   package@version    - Allow specific version
#
# Examples:
#   lodash@4.17.21
#   react@18.3.0
#   @babel/core@7.24.0
#
# Note:
# - Only version entries are supported (not date entries)
# - Denylist takes precedence over allowlist
